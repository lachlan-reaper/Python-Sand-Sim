This is an incredibly crude sand particle simulation created in ~10 hours with limited testing.

There is a capacity to add a greater variety of particles in [Particle.py](./Particle.py) however, particle interactions are not supported and only the particles constant physical state, velocity and density are simulated.
The constant particle creation is handled in the main loop, and can be added and/or modified.

This project will not be improved or iterated beyond its current capacity due to inherent issues with python performance and the current limitations of the physics simulation flow order.
